I’m excited to share my latest hashtag#PowerBI project — hashtag#Electronics_material_revenue Dashboard that helps visualize key business metrics like Total Revenue, Average Revenue, Total Sales, and identifies the top-performing product category.
🖋️ Key Insights :
 🌏 Asia emerged as the top-performing region, contributing over 60% of the total revenue.
💰 Smartphones generated the highest revenue, making them the most profitable product category.
📆 Q1 recorded peak sales, while revenue declined slightly in later quarters — indicating possible seasonality in performance.
🏬 Store 1 and Store 4 showed strong revenue generation compared to other stores.
 👨‍💻 Among sales representatives, Andrew T. achieved the highest total revenue.
 👩‍💻 younger customers (25–35 years) made up the majority of purchases.
